MCS-GA
Monte Carlo Simulation and Genetic Algorithm

# Monte Carlo

There is a 90% and 10% chance of winning full and part projects
respectively. Full project will have 20-24 modules and part project will 10-12 modules.
There are about 50-100 tasks per modules and each task will take 5-10 days. The
resources vary between 3 to 7. What is the most likely time to complete the project?

# Genetic Algorithm (TSP)

To write the code to solve using GA for the following problem :
We  have 10 cities and need to cover all the cities minimizing the distance travelled. The distance between the cities are given as a CSV file.
